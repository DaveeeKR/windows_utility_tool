Windows utility tool

1) set execution policy to remotesigned (for executing next commands)
2) activate windows (currently only win11 home)
3) remove bloatware that comes with fresh install


Future plans:
- Add gui custom tkinter
- Add support for more os (with detecting which os is currently installed)
- Checkboxes for bloatware to select wich one needs to be deleted
- Add feature for installing soft such as discord, steam etc.
